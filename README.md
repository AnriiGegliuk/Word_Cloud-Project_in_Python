# Word_Cloud-Project_in_Python

Word Cloud is a data visualization technique used for representing text data in which the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance. Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud.

This is my first WordCloud project developed using Python.

It is based on Steve Jobs speeach Commencement Address at Stanford 2005 (Excerpt)
